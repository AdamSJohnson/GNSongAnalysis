The McGuire Sisters - Sincerely lyrics


Sincerely
Oh yes, sincerely
'Cause I love you so dearly
Please say you'll be mine

Sincerely
Oh, you know how I love you
I'll do anything for you
Please say you'll be mine

Oh Lord, won't you tell me why
I love that fella so
He doesn't want me
But I'll never, never, never, never let him go
