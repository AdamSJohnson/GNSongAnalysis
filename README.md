# GNSongAnalysis
A project for the spring 2017 Hack Potsdam event. Using the Gracenote API we grab songs and rank them using sentiment analysis.

# How to use this program
One could assume that runthis.py is the driver of this program, but keep in mind this code was written in 24 hours for a hack-a-thon. The file runthis.py was the file the GUI was to run with the data it collected. To truly run this program do the following:

```Python3 pygui.py```

# Whats next?
If I get some time I would like to update the GUI to use a webpage to drive the program. I would also like to add in functionality for linking to the songs on youtube or a similar service.
